1-1 For which reason is it better to run the container with a flag -e to give the environment variables rather than put them directly in the Dockerfile? 

Answer: it's better to run the container with a flag -e rather than putting them in the Dockerfile for privacy and confidentiality concerns. Anyone can access the image and see the Dockerfile but they can't access the environment variables given at runtime.
